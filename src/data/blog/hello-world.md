This is the beginning.

I used to write on Substack — until they had a data breach and I decided I didn't want someone else holding the keys to my words. Before that, I had a personal site that I abandoned. This time I'm doing it differently: **self-hosted, anonymous, owned entirely by me.**

## Why "burnedthoughts"?

Some thoughts are worth burning. Not because they're bad, but because the act of writing them down — and letting them go — is the point. What remains after the fire is what matters.

## What to expect

Short posts. Long posts. No schedule, no algorithm, no metrics-chasing. Just writing.

- Things I'm learning
- Things I'm building
- Things I can't stop thinking about

If any of it resonates, stick around. There's an [RSS feed](/rss.xml) if that's your thing.

*More soon.*
