This is the beginning.

I used to write on [Substack](https://substack.com/@burnedthoughts?) until about a week ago, when I found out they'd suffered a [data breach](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Breach/Substack). That was enough for me. I didn't want someone else holding the keys to my words any longer. So here we are: self-hosted, anonymous, and **owned entirely by me.**

## Why "burnedthoughts"?

Some thoughts are worth burning. Not because they're bad, but because the act of writing them down, and letting them go, is the point. What remains after the fire is what matters.

## What to expect

Short posts. Long posts. No schedule, no algorithm, no metrics-chasing. Just writing.

- Things I'm learning
- Things I'm building
- Things I can't stop thinking about

If any of it resonates, stick around. There's an [RSS feed](/rss.xml) if that's your thing.

*More soon.*
